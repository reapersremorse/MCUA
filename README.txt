Minecraft Utility Application

This Application is going to be an all in one Minecraft Utility Application.

This will be for modders, resourcepack makers, datapack makers and i plan to make this utility application usable for any games i make.(Adding Modding to my games maybe)

Plans:

Databases
   Texture grayscale database
   Particle Grayslake database
   Lang translation database
   Generalized stats for items and blocks database.
   Audio database
   Basic .json databases that match the textures. This will be all item and block models
   Complex .jsons that don't fit normal blocks and items. This will be all item and block models and the special models.
   Recipe database used to compare and contrast against other mods for conflicts.
   Loot table data base for compatibility 
   Data pack database for special things that can load without needing to make a mod.
   Modding example database with multiple examples for each. and Connect the forge docs for better explanations for things.
